		        	<div class="poem">
		        		<p>I’ve experienced a myriad of tormented nights<br />
						Dreaming of the taste<br />
						Of your love<br />
						The delectable flavor of you<br />
						I’m left contemplating<br />
						How I’d adore you<br />
						I want to be that man…<br /><br />

						The one tenderly caressing your face<br />
						I wish that it could be me<br />
						Extracting the essence of you<br />
						Staring into your soul<br />
						Retrieving joy<br />
						I should be that man…<br /><br />

						I can feel your intangible hand<br />
						More than an imaginary touch<br />
						Beyond immediate grasp<br />
						Mingling in euphoria<br />
						With all of my covert stares<br />
						I see you and me<br />
						Like Cleopatra and Mark Antony<br />
						He was her love<br />
						And she, his queen<br />
						I long to be that man…<br /><br />

						I want my love to fall on you<br />
						Like the misty May rain<br />
						I long to envelope you<br />
						In a passionate embrace<br />
						To provide both love and refuge<br />
						I wish I was that man…<br /><br />

						Allow me to be the one you run to<br />
						I want to be the one<br />
						The only one you need<br />
						The one that completes you<br />
						Delivering ecstasy on a platter<br />
						I don’t want to be a snack<br />
						Of infatuation<br />
						My desire is to nourish your heart.<br />
						Can I be that man?</p>
