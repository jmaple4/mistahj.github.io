		        		<p>Her eyes analyzing me<br />
						Going over me<br /><br />

						Iâ€™m too cool to notice<br /><br />

						Staring intently<br />
						At my being<br />
						Those almond eyes<br />
						Seemed to peek<br />
						Into my soul<br /><br />

						Now I,<br />
						With my cup half full<br />
						Of double mocha,<br />
						Was the center of attention<br /><br />

						Back to my mocha<br /><br />

						For such a delicious drink<br />
						The flavor faded<br />
						Into that skin<br />
						Seemingly untouched by human hands<br /><br />

						She was subliminally signaling me<br /><br />

						The smile in her eyes<br />
						As irresistible as the one<br />
						Formed by her mouth<br /><br />

						As I grew more conscious of myself<br />
						My sipping became slow<br /><br />

						I found myself developing<br />
						A grin<br />
						While starring over the brim<br />
						Of my cup</p>
