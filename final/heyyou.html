		        		<p>He sits and watches her smile<br />
						All the while thinking to himself<br />
						“I really know nothing about her<br />
						She intrigues me, but leaves me confused<br />
						What to do, what to do?”<br />
						Flustered and drawn, he continues to watch<br />
						Overcome with the scene, taking in what he’s seeing<br />
						Enchanted by the light her smile beams<br />
						“I wonder if she knows I think about her sometimes<br />
						If she could read minds, she’d peek into mine<br />
						And know that I see what she can’t in her beauty<br />
						The sparkle in her eyes that truly floors me<br />
						The gentle demeanor that singles her out”<br /><br />

						He wonders if she knows that<br />
						She is the reason he smiles when they speak<br />
						He loves to learn what makes her unique<br />
						How time with her becomes a blur<br />
						“I wonder if she can see it in my eyes<br />
						The joy that’s there from being with her”<br /><br />

						How could he let her know, when his mouth betrays him<br />
						He turns to pray when the feeling escapes him<br />
						That feeling of boldness, overcoming timidity<br />
						In his head it’s easy, the truth is simply<br />
						Letting her know is harder than he intended it to be<br />
						Had he the courage he’d let her know<br />
						That special nature she possessed, God happened to show<br />
						He just wants a chance to get to know,<br />
						More about her although…<br />
						His head works faster than lips allow<br />
						Maybe he’d write a letter<br />
						Tying up the thoughts as they roam<br />
						Or perhaps uncover his soul to her…<br />
						through a poem.</p>
