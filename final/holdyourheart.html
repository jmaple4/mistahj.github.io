		        		<p>could I hold your heart?<br />
						could I shelter all the painful feelings of your past?<br />
						could I provide that love that you claim to want<br />
						yet shy away from?<br />
						let my share my un-jaded perspective of you<br />
						share the beautiful projection that I’m presented with<br />
						not the undeserving facsimile that you see yourself as<br />
						there’s a layer of love in you<br />
						a layer of loveliness that’s deeper than the cosmetic aesthetic<br />
						deeper than the exaggerated example that you’re held to<br />
						it’s not that you don’t compare to anyone else<br />
						no one else compares to you<br />
						when you believe that, it will definitely show<br />
						bright as the luminescence that is held back by your lips<br />
						expose that smile, as it illuminates you and all you come into contact with<br />
						illuminates and radiates<br />
						give others the same warmth that I feel when I see you<br />
						touch them with little pieces of you<br />
						don’t be afraid to release that<br />
						and step away from outside expectations of you<br />
						you are who you are<br />
						no one else<br />
						can hurt you…<br />
						you are the only one who should determine<br />
						who you are<br />
						be determined to see<br />
						how beautiful you are</p>
