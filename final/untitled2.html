		        		<p>She teases me with lingering whispers<br />
						Quietly beckoning me to her realm of existence<br />
						Stumbling blindly, following the faceless void<br />
						I have no choice, it is inevitable<br />
						In this state of mind, obligation and desire are blurred<br />
						Chasing Amy leaves my eyes clouded with imperfect visions of perfection<br />
						Forcing all signs to point in the wrong direction<br />
						Leaving me susceptible to erroneously trudge forward<br />
						Down the road of insecurity<br />
						But she guides me<br />
						I find solace through the soothing voice she uses<br />
						To lead me<br />
						There’s a secure simplicity in the chemistry between us as one<br />
						As one it seems there can be nothing to impede<br />
						Possible intimate interactions between herself and me<br />
						What I can’t see is the future<br />
						My tunnel vision increases the opacity of the obvious<br />
						Explicitly inviting dreams to wreak havoc on my tender heart<br />
						This is the start of my explainable doubt<br />
						Are these feelings ones that can affect me adversely<br />
						From the inside out?<br />
						Is she the fruit through which my soul wants to be fed?<br />
						Or am I setting myself up to be the next fly caught in her web?<br />
						How could something so unclear affect me in such a way?<br />
						Melancholy days are brightened through the thought of her<br />
						Previous days become one progressive blur<br />
						Montell was fallin’, it seems I’ve fell<br />
						Into an abyss of potential happiness, or a seductive spell<br />
						Whether it’s right or wrong, hopefully time will be quick to reveal<br />
						Cause looking into my heart shows these feelings are definitely real</p>
