		        		<p>Sometimes in the serene embrace of evening’s quiet<br />
						I wonder if you think about me…<br />
						is it possible that in syncopated reciprocation<br />
						we linger in each other’s afterthoughts<br />
						fleeting moments of potential bliss met with a twist<br />
						of reality’s jovial and uncaring truth.<br />
						is it possible that of all the people in all the world<br />
						out of the many men that inhabit places near and far from you<br />
						that you consider how my day went?<br /><br />

						the truth is, as I sit at this computer<br />
						I am battling with my wits with the image of you<br />
						reconciling conflicting perceptions of your being<br />
						and when my mind is done playing tricks with me,<br />
						my heart considers the possibility of things to be<br />
						I’m not hungry for the stuff of imagination<br />
						infatuation isn’t a delectably enticing dish<br />
						yet, I seem to cherish it like it was finger lickin’ good.<br /><br />

						what would it look like if I asked you how you were doing?<br />
						could it possibly make me look like I’m desparate for you?<br />
						I’m not.<br />
						does it seem like I’m a lonely soul looking for anything?<br />
						I’m not.<br />
						I’m consistently content with the way that things are?<br />
						doesn’t seem like it</p>
