		        		<p>she visits me in late night episodes<br />
						melodramas in dreams, soap operas in unconsciousness<br />
						where thoughts once repressed, are manifested in tests<br />
						can the right choice be made before the plot unfolds<br />
						our reruns drive me wild, and in time I find that I miss<br />
						little things with her, that brought smiles and happiness<br />
						no commercial breaks in the joy that we have together<br />
						the artificial feelings of bliss that should never feel like this<br />
						so real, unforced, completely engrossing and sensuous<br />
						I want an interruption in service, but the connection’s too tough to sever<br />
						picture in picture shows me with and without her<br />
						and in the picture with her, I look much happier<br />
						there has to be a problem with the receiver<br />
						a malfunction in my mind’s widescreen television set<br />
						trying to change the channels has completely no effect<br />
						she seems to have changed in character, but can I believe her?<br />
						realizing that control of the screen is no longer with me<br />
						I’m wishing for a life that I can lead more comfortably<br />
						I endure the interpretation of grandeur I’m inheriting</p>
