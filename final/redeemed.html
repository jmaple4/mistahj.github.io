		        		<p>marked by a life of finding value in the hungry eyes of men<br />
						lots of “love at first sight”<br />
						sex the first night,<br />
						trying to find that mr. right<br />
						left her knowing how to look beautiful, while being empty within<br />
						she doesn’t even know what she wants anymore<br />
						past that feeling…<br />
						that feeling of acceptance and love that breezes in with the next man<br />
						thinking maybe this would be her new chance<br />
						the new beginning that love now owes her<br />
						“double or nothing heart” there’s nothing left to lose<br />
						just another empty risk in the pursuit of happiness<br />
						draining more of the innocence lost with that first kiss<br /><br />

						see, she’s always had the idea that it would be easiest<br />
						to gain a man’s heart in exchange for her body<br />
						tits and ass being love currency, and in which she was wealthy<br />
						although for all the dollars and cents she spent, she couldn’t buy love<br />
						all that she could afford was rental affection<br />
						usually due for return in less than 7 days<br />
						with each return, what she began to learn<br />
						was how to better herself for the men she pursued<br />
						she neglected to learn herself better<br />
						and whether from the lack of care or lack of attention<br />
						internally she began to break down<br /><br />

						what she began to find was that in most men’s minds<br />
						she was nothing but a quick fix for lust<br />
						and in that lust she began to trust<br />
						she gave her heart while they gave their manhood to her<br />
						a simple object of their desires, she aspired to do more<br />
						who would think of her as more than just a partner now?<br />
						just a good pastime or a stress reliever with no strings attached<br />
						because when her heart’s attacked none of them have to react<br />
						not their woman, not their problem, when the good time is over<br />
						and she’s left to wallow in the pity of her own despair<br /><br />

						All it takes is one. one person to see past the outside and reach her<br />
						teach her that the best things for her won’t come from another<br />
						her confidence and reliance on men will cause her nothing but pain<br />
						someone who will love her and cherish her, despite her feelings of shame<br />
						she can come out of this situation perfectly sane.<br />
						His love can renew all things to their once perfect luster<br />
						Polish her heart and her life, make things right, establish trust in her<br />
						Because in His eyes, she is the most beautiful thing<br />
						Exquisite in design, conceived in love and desired<br />
						All the things that she’s done are nothing<br />
						He’s endured much more for her.<br /><br />

						The prayer is that you take her and redeem her<br />
						Bless it so she has higher self esteem<br />
						For those nights when the loneliness seems to triple<br />
						When it feels like no one respects of cares for her<br />
						He’s there holding her up on a pedestal<br />
						He loves her like the precious child that she is<br />
						A child that is His and just needs to see it<br />
						Her tarnished heart can be once again cleaned<br />
						The woman that she was when she dreamed<br />
						Can be the woman who once leaned<br />
						On the hearts of men…<br />
						Only on Him does she have to depend<br />
						When she learns that she has the heart of gold<br />
						And that there is much worth to her soul<br />
						Darkness and despair can no longer have her double teamed<br />
						Because in Him she can fully be redeemed</p>
