		        		<p>Power inebriates those in charge<br />
						drunk with authority, leaving scars<br />
						on the hearts of those without it<br />
						stomping on people trying to re-route it<br />
						the highest power is absolute<br />
						it can’t be shared by a group<br />
						suffering is more of a group ethic<br />
						people like to compare how their lives are pathetic<br />
						complaining replaces the drive to get it<br />
						the potential is latent, no one wants to use it<br />
						anyone can have it<br />
						the power’s up for whoever grabs it<br />
						when mental capacity matches tenacity<br />
						beautiful things happen, if pursued passionately</p>
