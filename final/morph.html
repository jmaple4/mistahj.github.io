		        		<p>fall into a space of nothing<br />
						free from judgement, pessimism, hate<br />
						lacking love, joy, excitement and happiness<br />
						just existing in a realm of yourself<br />
						being caught in thought<br />
						in a realm where you seldom fail<br />
						or where success keeps you from accepting defeat<br />
						take a step into your inner void<br />
						observe your thoughts and fears<br />
						see how youe inhibitions fall away<br />
						like dead skin attacked by a pumice stone<br />
						shed your layer of self criticism<br />
						accept what you’re given, listening to bio-rhythms<br />
						catch a glimpse of the person God made you to be<br />
						let what you represent be evident<br />
						a being of love with Jesus as resident<br />
						allow life’s opus, like, osmosis, to filter through to your soul<br />
						to the part of you where conscious grew<br />
						the you finding refuge in your heart<br />
						let that person receive pure joy and pleasure<br />
						lose the imitation forms of the two<br />
						become the person you’re meant to be<br />
						never settle for being a carbon copy of you</p>
