		        		<p>With the way you’re interacting with me<br />
							I can’t say realistically, me meeting you wasn’t destiny<br />
							Unexpectedly, I was surprised pleasantly<br />
							By receiving a blessing in disguise<br />
							Special delivery straight from the skies<br />
							Can’t believe my luck every time I look in your eyes<br />
							Our love’s the real thing tested and tried<br />
							Within you, I see a place where my love can reside<br />
							I wanna be like the sun<br />
							Rise and fall with you, letting two souls become one<br />
							My parents disapprove, my friends may shun<br />
							But I ignore, cause you’re huggin and lovin’ me when the day is done<br />
							I can say it’s over for other girls<br />
							Cause you are my world<br />
							In an ocean of oysters, you’re my pearl<br />
							Seemingly impossible, like a diamond crafted from sand<br />
							Yes ma’am<br />
							I can say that I am<br />
							Devoted and dedicated, struggling yet motivated<br />
							To acquire this love, for so long I have waited<br />
							I sat patiently<br />
							Knowing eventually, that goodness would come to me<br />
							Much sooner than later, I saw you walk into that door<br />
							Standing before me, the answer to my prayers and more<br />
							Beautiful, tantalizing, joyful, I truly adore<br />
							Your smile, your style, secretly admiring what you stand for<br />
							Now I stand here glowing, my heart is ablaze<br />
							On fire, with the desire to love you always<br /><br />

							I do…</p>
