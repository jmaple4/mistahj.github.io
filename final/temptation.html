		        		<p>well, it’s been a while and I’m still haunted by dreams of you<br />
						visions of how things could be, how long they could’ve gone and why they didn’t<br />
						within minutes, I’m reminded of the obstructions clouding my perfect view<br />
						seeing reality, I can’t help but want to take what happened and spin it<br />
						adjust it to something less painful, tweak it to something beautiful<br />
						appealing apparitions of the joy that I wanted to exist for us<br />
						deep down, I don’t want to admit that actually, being with you could be terrible<br />
						it would compromise all that I am<br />
						and I’m not trying to be adventurous<br />
						with a side of me that I’ve left in my past<br />
						the antique me had no problem with the situation this attraction posed<br />
						I knew that such a union would raise problems and I could never last<br />
						in moving on, I realized that a vital chapter had never been closed<br />
						I never imagined that I’d consider you to be a perfect vision<br />
						although you lack the biggest attracting factor<br />
						very few since you have been capable of attracting my attention<br />
						but truth be told, you couldn’t be the one I abandoned everything for<br />
						the road I’ve traveled has been too far and too good<br />
						despite the cracks and divits that have slowed me down<br />
						no other diversions posed the dangers that you could<br />
						a person like you, for me, has yet to be found<br />
						how cruel can the hands of fate seem to be<br />
						when chasing a dream<br />
						trying to find that special someone in whom love could have resided<br />
						seems I’ve been successfully falling on my face in scheme after scheme<br />
						why can’t I move on with things and be happy with the way I decided?<br />
						that gaining a relationship with you would never be worth losing it all<br />
						these visions pushing and pulling the strings of my heart offsetting my balance<br />
						for a guilty pleasure<br />
						I just cannot afford to take the fall<br />
						still something in me yearns to take our relationship out of the past tense…</p>
