		        		<p>Imagine raw passion<br />
						Glorious and deep<br />
						With impressions<br />
						Of him<br />
						His chiseled silhouette<br />
						In her head<br />
						The picture composed<br />
						On wildly rigid canvas<br />
						Every painful icon shimmering<br />
						Like shimmering glass<br />
						A surreal masterpiece<br />
						Sculpted just for her<br />
						She remembers his gentle demeanor<br />
						His soft touch<br />
						His sweet breath on her neck<br />
						He was just too good to be true<br />
						They blended perfectly<br />
						Her desire for him was great<br />
						As strong as her desire to live<br />
						The memories grew more vivid<br />
						As she sketched him<br />
						She cumulated eight years of him<br />
						In pencil stroke after pencil stroke</p>
