		        		<p>Taking a second to look up from my double mocha<br />
						with two shots of chocolate syrup,<br />
						just the way I like it.<br />
						I noticed her honey brown hair<br /><br />

						Caught a glimpse<br />
						of the world’s most alluring smile<br /><br />

						Being that I’m just too cool<br />
						to be caught staring<br />
						I returned to my mocha<br />
						which was surprisingly strong<br /><br />

						There was more than enough coffee in my cup,<br />
						but I couldn’t help thinking about<br />
						that little caramel drop in the corner<br />
						that would’ve made my drink a lot sweeter<br /><br />

						But I don’t trip over women<br />
						no, not me<br />
						back to my paper.<br />
						back to the mocha<br /><br />

						The mocha that I had been craving all day<br />
						that mocha<br />
						the one that I couldn’t get out of my mind<br />
						suddenly sprouted legs,<br />
						shapely hips,<br />
						pouty lips,<br />
						and almond eyes<br /><br />

						I was being consumed<br />
						consumed by what I had been consuming<br />
						as I resumed consciousness,<br />
						I caught myself<br />
						in full stare<br /><br />

						I also found<br />
						those delicious eyes<br />
						had found their way to me…</p>
