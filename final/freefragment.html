		        		<p>Last night I fell into conversation with myself<br />
						I had to wonder. Where have you been?<br />
						I have to ask, because literally, lingering around dark corners has been a doppleganger.<br />
						Absolutely not who I would’ve expected to see when hearing the things that I’ve heard<br />
						seeing life the way I’ve seen, I mean it’s just absurd to think that this could be a dead ringer<br />
						for the excitable young man who seemingly used to reside here.<br />
						I’m afraid that I’ve been forced to stomach facsimiles, faulty and flawed<br />
						these inadequacies that you’ve been trying hide behind, trying to sow society’s sod<br />
						were you serious when you tried to stuff me into that neat equilateral box<br />
						tucked away and replaced with the things that would smooth down your edges<br />
						you sneakily pledged that the real you wouldn’t stand to tarnish the good name you’ve made<br />
						you stayed stuck in a stifling fog, stumbling while sheepishly maintaining appearances<br />
						while the grass seems greener on the other side, you almost allowed your essence to die<br />
						taking pride in the product that clever pruning projected, covering the turmoil that pretending belied<br />
						it’s an odd feeling, being held hostage, forced to play third string, backseat driver to manufactured traits<br />
						you got sucked into the addiction of protecting yourself, no realization of what the cost is<br />
						fading your true colors to muted hues, whose sparkling you accosted<br />
						it’s no wonder you felt like you had no say in things,<br />
						you silenced your inner voice, smothered it simply to a whimper<br />
						all I ever wanted was to represent you. Truly you, the amazing creation you were conceived to be<br />
						the thing that you’ve become seems to have lost connection,<br />
						introspection would uncover the motivation that keeps you subdued in places you can’t believe<br />
						transforming that darkness into a light, never ceasing to gleam<br />
						I’ve been tucked away, waiting for this opportunity, to shed some light on a few things I’ve pondered<br />
						for this chance to resurface, I am honored.<br />
						the quintessential element for you to try to stay relevant is finding your voice<br />
						your words will ring fierce like the roar of a tiger<br />
						metaphors, similes, and stanzas fully inspired, delivered powerfully spoken<br />
						rising like smoke in the midst of rambling and infernos of indecipherable noise</p>
