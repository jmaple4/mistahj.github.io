				<p>I'm Justin... Equal parts whimsy, musical, silly, and focused. "What a guy!" (I know, right?)					I'm really into taking pictures, and I like creating webpages. These are my attempts to be creative
					and really see what my mind can do!</p>

			<div class="bio_content">
				<p>Ever since I was young, I enjoyed learning about the interwebs and everything that is possible within the world of this series of interconnected tubes. I'm a super fan of all things social media, and you might even try to follow me... (at least on instagram, I take good pictures!).</p>

				<p>I can usually be found traipsing around San Francisco, trying to find the best hamburger in city, following around hoopers with my camera, or people watching out in Dolores Park. I have also been known to be spotted around in the city of Oakland, where I live.</p>
