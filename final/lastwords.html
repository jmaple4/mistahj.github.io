		        		<p>I knew they were no good<br />
						Not the kind of people you’d want for friends<br />
						I could see it in their eyes<br />
						Their devilishly deceptive grins<br /><br />

						“Awww mom, stop worrying”<br />
						You told me you’d be just fine<br />
						I knew better however<br />
						I knew that it was reason you wouldn’t find<br /><br />

						I begged you not to go,<br />
						You wouldn’t stay<br />
						It pains me because I know<br />
						That’s why you’re not with me today<br /><br />

						Why couldn’t you listen to me?<br />
						You could’ve heeded my cry<br />
						I can’t bring you back now<br />
						No matter how hard I try<br /><br />

						I knew there would be alcohol there<br />
						And drunken guys galore<br />
						I guess you were just lonely<br />
						And wanted to explore<br /><br />

						Did you stop to think?<br />
						Before you picked up that glass?<br />
						How this would affect your poor mother<br />
						How the effects would last?<br /><br />

						Your friends told me that you left with a guy<br />
						He wanted you to follow him into a room<br />
						He told you not to worry<br />
						You’d be back soon<br /><br />

						He threw you on the bed<br />
						He knew you were drunk<br />
						He stripped you and had his way with you<br />
						That little punk<br /><br />

						No one tried to help you<br />
						Your friends all heard you scream<br />
						They paid you no attention<br />
						They were too into the “scene”<br /><br />

						Afterwards he began to beat you<br />
						He choked you until you lost your breath<br />
						He continued strangling<br />
						Until you reached your death<br /><br />

						Now through the heavy tears I look back<br />
						On your life and how it was<br />
						How all your potential was lost<br />
						Just because<br /><br />

						If only you would’ve listened<br />
						Maybe you would be able to see<br />
						I only wanted to save you<br />
						The same exact thing<br />
						Almost happened to me.</p>
