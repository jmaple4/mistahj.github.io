		        		<p>Lying deliriously in my bed<br />
						I surrender to sleep<br />
						Dreaming of her chocolate skin<br />
						Her sweet honey smell<br />
						She wanders through my head<br />
						Then vanishes<br />
						Like shadows in light<br />
						Recalling the vision weakly<br />
						Empty and void of beauty<br />
						I cry out franticly<br />
						Still I ache for love<br />
						Oh, the pain…<br /><br />

						I long for the warmth of her arms<br />
						Her smile lighting up my life<br />
						Endless days of gray<br />
						Enveloped in pain<br />
						She has caused me the ultimate hurt<br />
						Inducing suffering that can kill a man<br />
						I’m lacking the vitality<br />
						To fight this off<br />
						Still I ache for relief<br />
						The pain endures…<br /><br />

						Sleepless nights<br />
						Followed by non-productive days<br />
						Swallowed up by the follies of life<br />
						I’m tormented by the memory of her<br />
						By what it was that she meant to me<br />
						I will never be able to get that back<br />
						No matter how much I cry for it<br />
						Save me from this hell<br />
						My face, no longer mine<br />
						It resembles the young hamlet<br />
						Suffering enduring troubles<br />
						Still I ache for peace<br />
						The pain just won’t stop…</p>
