		        		<p>My unsuspecting heart<br />
						has once again fallen upon blind eyes<br />
						meaningless charades often take place<br />
						I’ve put myself into a volatile role<br />
						one where my emotions can’t be controlled<br />
						I portray one thing<br />
						while I’m thinking of something else<br />
						conflicting positions ripping me apart<br />
						I’m gift wrap in the hands of a child<br />
						duality is suffocating me<br />
						I cannot play both roles<br />
						when my heart wants to follow one<br />
						though door number 1 is unlocked<br />
						I’m being forced through door number 2<br />
						though I know what I want<br />
						I feel like I’m wrong<br />
						damned if for once, I can’t do what I feel<br />
						I think now is the most pain<br />
						I’ve felt in a long, long while<br />
						why do I care? I don’t know how much I want it<br />
						the driving fact is that I do<br />
						I care enough<br />
						enough to go constantly crazy<br />
						falling prey to unnecessary anguish<br />
						I want to close my eyes and wish myself away<br />
						to be pardoned from this sentence<br />
						I don’t know why I deserve this<br />
						but forgiveness I pray<br />
						as each day a little more of me deteriorates<br />
						falling susceptible to the fallacies of infatuation<br />
						I envy someone’s privilege<br />
						someone more deserving than me</p>
