		        		<p>sometimes the words hold no mysterious power<br />
						nothing’s hard hitting, head splitting, or tugs at the heart<br />
						the hardest part is realizing my vernacular dysfunction<br />
						the assumption is that this is what I do, it should be easy<br />
						something I loved to do should never bereave me<br />
						leavin’ me to deal with the loss of my multi-syllabic gumption<br />
						worst part about it is, these “rappers” come up with all kinds of “hotness”<br />
						it seems easy to get a hit, just open your mouth with some nonsense<br />
						people hearing these flows, by default, they think they’re sick<br />
						I think they got diarrhea, droppin’ uncontrollable shit<br />
						people ain’t listening to the words that are written<br />
						a blatant omission, thanks to the beats that are rippin’<br />
						times like these are when the words should hold meaning<br />
						the craftsmanship of the letters is what I’m needing<br />
						simply because it doesn’t seem that I’m metaphorically sound<br />
						my mind is kept latent with my pencil laid down<br />
						the creative spirit in me was flatlinin’<br />
						In actuality, what I’m writing matters less than the fact that I do it<br />	
						time to stop dreaming, pick up the pen & pursue it</p>
