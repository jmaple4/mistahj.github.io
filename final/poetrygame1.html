		        		<p>Silly of me to think that I’d captured your freelancing heart…<br />
						I had no indication of your full attention<br />
						yet I was confident your affections were less than fleeting<br />
						you inconspicuously invaded my thoughts<br />
						all indications pointed to reciprocation of my feelings<br />
						sinisterly nestled among the flirty notes we shared<br />
						was the perfect escape plan<br />
						we connected through vivacious and imaginative unbearing of our souls<br />
						I was able to trade hopeless ideas of us<br />
						with light touches,<br />
						gentle brushes focused us as feelings began to grow<br />
						Although I knew much better,<br />
						I was subdued by the allure of reckless abandon<br />
						filled with illusions of besting your initial resistance<br />
						it was as if my longing willed us to be<br />
						as quickly as it started, you killed the ignition<br />
						After all… it was factual that what we had<br />
						was literally the fodder for someone’s poem about forbidden fruit<br />
						a beautiful mistake.<br />
						All at once, I was filled with the knowledge that all I amounted to for you<br />
						was a lusty lapse of judgement, come to an ugly head<br />
						and with one masterful stroke of your hand<br />
						I was dispassionately dismissed<br />
						left to piece together the shards of my apparently misplaced emotions<br />
						silly of me to think that I’d captured your freelancing heart…<br /><br />

						silly of me to think that I’d made a place for myself there…<br /><br />

						silly of me to think that I was the only one…<br /><br />

						silly of me not to protect my own…<br /><br />

						silly of me to blame you for these feelings…<br /><br />

						silly of me for finding myself wanting you to care…<br /><br />

						just silly</p>
